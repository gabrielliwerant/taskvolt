# TaskVolt

Local todo app running on react/redux toolkit.

This is an ongoing experiment with the purpose of eventually creating an embeddable todo list with extensible functionality to be dictated by the user. Another potentiality is the democratization/decentralization of the todo list concept. Details to be fleshed out in a road map when available.
